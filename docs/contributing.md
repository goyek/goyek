## Developing

Go and Docker is required.

Run `./goyek.sh` (Bash) or `.\goyek.ps1` (PowerShell) [wrapper scripts](../README.md#wrapper-scripts) to execute the build pipeline.

You may use [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/goyek/goyek) to experiment with the codebase.

The [releasing documentation](releasing.md) describes how to prepare and publish a new release.
