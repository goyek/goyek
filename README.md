## Description

**goyek** (/Àà…°…î…™√¶k/ [üîä listen](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%CB%88%C9%A1%C9%94%C9%AA%C3%A6k))
is used to create build pipelines in Go.
As opposed to many other tools, it is just a Go library.

Here are some good parts:

- It is cross-platform and shell independent.
- No binary installation is needed. Simply add it to `go.mod` like any other Go module.
  - You can be sure that everyone uses the same version of **goyek**.
- It has low learning curve, thanks to the minimal API surface,
  documentation, and examples.
- The task's action look like a unit test.
  It is even possible to use [`testify`](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
  or [`is`](https://github.com/matryer/is) for asserting.
- It is easy to debug, like a regular Go application.
- You can reuse code like in any Go application.
  It may be helpful to use packages like:
  - [`github.com/bitfield/script`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bitfield/script)
  - [`github.com/rjeczalik/notify`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rjeczalik/notify)
  - [`github.com/magefile/mage/target`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/magefile/mage/target)
  - [`github.com/mattn/go-shellwords`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mattn/go-shellwords)
- Tasks and helpers can be unit tested. For example, see [cmd_test.go](cmd_test.go).
- [`github.com/goyek/goyek` package](go.mod) does not use any third-party dependency
  other than the Go standard library.

**goyek** API is mainly inspired by the [`testing`](https://golang.org/pkg/testing),
[`http`](https://golang.org/pkg/http), and [`flag`](https://golang.org/pkg/flag)
packages.

## Quick start

Copy and paste the following code into [`build/build.go`](examples/basic/main.go):

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/goyek/goyek"
)

func main() {
	flow := &goyek.Flow{}

	flow.Register(goyek.Task{
		Name:  "hello",
		Usage: "demonstration",
		Action: func(tf *goyek.TF) {
			tf.Log("Hello world!")
		},
	})

	flow.Main()
}
```

Run:

```shell
go mod tidy
```

Sample usage:

```shell
$ go run ./build -h
Usage: [flag(s) | task(s)]...
Flags:
  -v     Default: false    Verbose: log all tasks as they are run.
  -wd    Default: .        Working directory: set the working directory.
Tasks:
  hello    demonstration
```

```shell
$ go run ./build hello
ok     0.000s
```

```shell
$ go run ./build hello -v
===== TASK  hello
      main.go:14: Hello world!
----- PASS: hello (0.00s)
ok      0.001s
```

## Wrapper scripts

Instead of executing `go run ./build`,
you can use the wrapper scripts,
which can be invoked from any location.

- [`goyek.sh`](goyek.sh)
- [`goyek.ps1`](goyek.ps1)

Simply add them to your repository's root directory
and make sure to add the `+x` permission:

```sh
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goyek/goyek/main/goyek.sh -O
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goyek/goyek/main/goyek.ps1 -O
git add --chmod=+x goyek.sh goyek.ps1
```

## Repository template

You can use [goyek/template](https://github.com/goyek/template)
to create a new repository

For an existing repository you can copy most of its files.

## Examples

- [examples](examples)
- [build/build.go](build/build.go) -
  this repository's own build pipeline (dogfooding)
- [fluentassert](https://github.com/fluentassert/verify) -
  a library using **goyek** without polluting it's root `go.mod`
- [splunk-otel-go](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-go) -
  a multi-module monorepo using **goyek**

## Features

### Task registration

The registered tasks are required to have a non-empty name, matching
the regular expression [`TaskNamePattern`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goyek/goyek#TaskNamePattern).
This means the following are acceptable:

- letters (`a-z` and `A-Z`)
- digits (`0-9`)
- underscore (`_`)
- hyphen (`-`) - except at the beginning
- plus (`+`) - except at the beginning
- colon (`:`) - except at the beginning

A task with a given name can be only registered once.

A task without description is not listed in CLI usage.

### Task action

Task action is a function which is executed when a task is executed.

It is not required to set a action.
Not having a action is very handy when registering "pipelines".

### Task dependencies

During task registration it is possible to add a dependency
to an already registered task.
When the flow is processed,
it makes sure that the dependency is executed before the current task is run.
Take note that each task will be executed at most once.

### Helpers for running programs

Use [`func (tf *TF) Cmd(name string, args ...string) *exec.Cmd`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goyek/goyek#TF.Cmd)
to run a program inside a task's action.

You can use it create your own helpers, for example:

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"os/exec"

	"github.com/goyek/goyek"
	"github.com/mattn/go-shellwords"
)

func Exec(cmdLine string) func(tf *goyek.TF) {
	args, err := shellwords.Parse(cmdLine)
	if err != nil {
		panic(fmt.Sprintf("parse command line: %v", err))
	}
	return func(tf *goyek.TF) {
    tf.Logf("Run '%s'", cmdLine)
		if err := tf.Cmd(args[0], args[1:]...).Run(); err != nil {
			tf.Error(err)
		}
	}
}
```

[Here](https://github.com/goyek/goyek/issues/60) is the explanation
why argument splitting is not included out-of-the-box.

### Verbose mode

Enable verbose output using the `-v` CLI flag.
It works similar to `go test -v`. Verbose mode streams all logs to the output.
If it is disabled, only logs from failed task are send to the output.

Use [`func (f *Flow) VerboseParam() BoolParam`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goyek/goyek#Flow.VerboseParam)
if you need to check if verbose mode was set within a task's action.

The default value for the verbose parameter can be overwritten with
[`func (f *Flow) RegisterVerboseParam(p BoolParam) RegisteredBoolParam`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goyek/goyek#Flow.RegisterVerboseParam).

### Default task

Default task can be assigned via the [`Flow.DefaultTask`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goyek/goyek#Flow.DefaultTask)
field.

When the default task is set, then it is run if no task is provided via CLI.

### Parameters

The parameters can be set via CLI using the flag syntax.

On the CLI, flags can be set in the following ways:

- `-param simple` - for simple single-word values
- `-param "value with blanks"`
- `-param="value with blanks"`
- `-param` - setting boolean parameters implicitly to `true`

For example, `./goyek.sh test -v -pkg ./...` would run the `test` task
with `v` bool parameter (verbose mode) set to `true`,
and `pkg` string parameter set to `"./..."`.

Parameters must first be registered via
[`func (f *Flow) RegisterValueParam(newValue func() ParamValue, info ParamInfo) ValueParam`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goyek/goyek#Flow.RegisterValueParam),
or one of the provided methods like [`RegisterStringParam`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goyek/goyek#Flow.RegisterStringParam).

The registered parameters are required to have a non-empty name, matching
the regular expression [`ParamNamePattern`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goyek/goyek#ParamNamePattern).
This means the following are acceptable:

- letters (`a-z` and `A-Z`)
- digits (`0-9`)
- underscore (`_`) - except at the beginning
- hyphen (`-`) - except at the beginning
- plus (`+`) - except at the beginning
- colon (`:`) - except at the beginning

After registration, tasks need to specify which parameters they will read.
Do this by assigning the [`RegisteredParam`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goyek/goyek#RegisteredParam)
instance from the registration result to the [`Task.Params`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goyek/goyek#Task.Params)
field.
If a task tries to retrieve the value from an unregistered parameter,
the task will fail.

When registration is done, the task's action can retrieve the parameter value
using the `Get(*TF)` method from the registration result instance
during the task's `Action` execution.

See [examples/parameters/main.go](examples/parameters/main.go)
for a detailed example.

See [examples/validation/main.go](examples/validation/main.go)
for a detailed example of cross-parameter validation.

`Flow` will fail execution if there are unused parameters.

### Supported Go versions

Minimal supported Go version is 1.11.

## Alternatives

### Make

While [Make (Makefile)](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is currently
the _de facto_ standard, it has some pitfalls:

- Requires to learn Make, which is not so easy.
- It is hard to develop a Makefile which is truly cross-platform.
- Debugging and testing Make targets is not fun.

However, if you know Make and are happy with it, do not change it.
Make is very powerful and a lot of stuff can be made faster,
if you know how to use it.

**goyek** is intended to be simpler and easier to learn,
more portable, while still being able to handle most use cases.

### Mage

[Mage](https://github.com/magefile/mage) is a framework/tool which magically discovers
the [targets](https://magefile.org/targets/) from [magefiles](https://magefile.org/magefiles/),
which results in some drawbacks:

- Requires using [build tags](https://magefile.org/magefiles/).
- Reusing tasks is [hacky](https://magefile.org/importing/).
- Requires installation or using [zero install option](https://magefile.org/zeroinstall/)
  which is slow.
- Debugging would be extermly complex.
- Magical by design (of course one may like it).

**goyek** is a non-magical alternative for [Mage](https://github.com/magefile/mage).
Write regular Go code. No build tags, special names for functions, tricky imports.

### Task

While [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) is simpler and easier to use
than [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/),
but it still has similar problems:

- Requires to learn Task's YAML structure and
  the [minimalistic, cross-platform interpreter](https://github.com/mvdan/sh#gosh)
  which it uses.
- Debugging and testing tasks is not fun.
- Hard to make reusable tasks.
- Requires to "install" the tool.

### Bazel

[Bazel](https://bazel.build/) is a very sophisticated tool which is
[created to efficiently handle complex and long-running build pipelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazel_(software)#Rationale).
It requires the build target inputs and outputs to be fully specified.

**goyek** is just a simple Go library that is mainly supposed to create a build pipeline
consisting of commands like `go vet`, `go test`, `go build`.
However, nothing prevents you from, for example,
using the [Mage's target package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/magefile/mage/target)
to make your build pipeline more efficient.
